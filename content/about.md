title: About
---

This is my website containing both my professional works and my hobbies, which are becoming intertwined somewhat. Professionally I am an investor and a computer programmer.
My hobbies include these professional activities as well as kitesurfing, snowboarding, wakeboarding, photography, hiking, scubadiving, camping, mountain biking, and poker.
If you think I am missing any good hobbies please let me know, I clearly need more. Check out my social media and photography page for more on those.

My investing and programming are one in the same as I focus on the use of data science and machine learning in the investment process. I come from 7 years in fundamental investment management where I merged data science and 
portfolio optimization techniques into a purely fundamental investing framework, which resulted in better performance and efficiency. My main focuses professionally are in algorithmic trading, optimization, and hopefully one day in increasing the accessibility of
highly technilogical and sophisticated investment mechanisms for the average investor.

I was born and raised in Lake Hopatcong New Jersey, went to Rutgers University, worked in Jersey City and am pursuing my Masters in Financial Engineering from Cornell University.

Hope you enjoy my website.
